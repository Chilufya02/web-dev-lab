Description:
This repository contains the lab work for CSC-4035: Introduction to Web Programming and Technologies, focusing on practical exercises to build foundational web development skills. The lab includes tasks such as installing essential tools (VS Code, Git, Node.js), setting up GitHub for version control, creating a basic webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and pushing projects to GitHub. Additionally, it emphasizes collaboration by having students work in teams to review and merge changes using GitHub's pull request feature. These activities are designed to provide hands-on experience with key tools and workflows in modern web development.
